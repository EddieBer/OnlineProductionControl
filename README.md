# <h1>Real-time Control</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project dealt with the development of an application that would display data collected from the machines on the shop floor in Real-time. 

The organization for which I performed this project  had a lot of valuable information on the shop floor that it couldn't collect and analyze in an efficient manner.

<h4>Project Goals:</h4>
1. Creating real-time visualizations by high frequency collection of data from the shop floor.
